# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
***I feel okay about it. I need more clarification about return values when puts statements are involved"***

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
***Very confident***

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
***What is the return value on this method? I think it would be name.
 def prints_name(name)
 name
 end***

 ***What is the return value on this method? I think it would be nil.
  def prints_name(name)
  puts name
  end***

  ***After you define a method does it change the return value if you
  use p or puts to call that method?***
